# Projects 

## Finding Donors for charity ML
Used real census to Predict how likely a Person will donate for charity, build models using different supervised learning algorithms and examine
them using accuracy and f1- score.

## Creating Customer Segments 
Reviewed unstructured data to understand the patterns and natural categories that the data fits into. Used multiple algorithms both empirically
and theoretically compared and contrasted their results. Made predictions about the natural categories of multiple types in a dataset, then 
checked these predictions against the result of unsupervised analysis.

## Dog Breed Classifier 
Use CNN's to build a model that classifies the breed of a dog , it also detects human and show the corresponding resembling breed . Used 
Transfer learning to obtain the results.

## How to Train a Quadcopter to fly 
Applied Reinforcement learning techniques to train a quadcopter for tasks such as hovering and Take - off . This model involves the agent to 
learn the task keeping in picture the rewards and penalties for each step.
